## Conway's Game of Life

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a simulation system with extremely simple rules that can evolve into very complex patterns. I find it helpful in understanding biological evolution and GenAI.

I wrote a simple playground in Python ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KeriYuu/Conway-s-Game-of-Life)). You can generate random initial states and let them evolve. Eventually, some magical patterns will "survive", such as:

- Rakes: Moving patterns that leave debris behind, which can be used to "lay tracks".

- Breeders: Patterns that produce streams of gliders, causing the number of live cells to grow quadratically or faster.

During my undergraduate studies in physics, I learned about the concept of "emergence" - how complex structures or behaviors can arise from simple microscopic rules. Engineers can create controllable systems from these seemingly chaotic structures, similar to how we work with AI black boxes today.
